2. **Ratings:** Excellent (no major flaws, advances field), Good (sound with minor issues), Satisfactory (acceptable with limits), Needs Improvement (significant flaws), Poor (fundamental problems).
3. **Specificity:** "Uses novel attention mechanism for temporal dependencies" (good) vs "Well-written paper" (bad).
4. **Questions:** Ask specific, answerable questions that validate the work. Avoid yes/no questions.
5. **Issues:** Major = affects validity or has fundamental flaws. Minor = typos, formatting, small clarifications.
