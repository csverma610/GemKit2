    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) applications such as agents and domain-specific reasoning increasingly rely on context adaptationâ€”modifying inputs with instructions, strategies, or evidence, rather than weight updates. Prior approaches improve usability but often suffer from brevity bias, which drops domain insights for concise summaries, and from context collapse, where iterative rewriting erodes details over time. Building on the adaptive memory introduced by Dynamic Cheatsheet, we introduce ACE (Agentic Context Engineering), a framework that treats contexts as evolving playbooks that accumulate, refine, and organize strategies through a modular process of generation, reflection, and curation. ACE prevents collapse with structured, incremental updates that preserve detailed knowledge and scale with long-context models. Across agent and domain-specific benchmarks, ACE optimizes contexts both offline (e.g., system prompts) and online (e.g., agent memory), consistently outperforming strong baselines: +10.6% on agents and +8.6% on finance, while significantly reducing adaptation latency and rollout cost. Notably, ACE could adapt effectively without labeled supervision and instead by leveraging natural execution feedback. On the AppWorld leaderboard, ACE matches the top-ranked production-level agent on the overall average and surpasses it on the harder test-challenge split, despite using a smaller open-source model. These results show that comprehensive, evolving contexts enable scalable, efficient, and self-improving LLM systems with low overhead.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces Agentic Context Engineering (ACE), a novel framework for continuously evolving and refining LLM contexts. ACE addresses critical limitations of existing methods, such as 'brevity bias' and 'context collapse,' by treating contexts as dynamic playbooks that accumulate and organize strategies through a modular generation, reflection, and curation process. The framework demonstrates significant performance improvements across agent and domain-specific benchmarks, achieving higher accuracy and substantial reductions in adaptation latency and cost, even when using smaller open-source models. Its ability to self-improve without labeled supervision makes it a highly promising approach for scalable and efficient LLM systems."

  "methodology": {
    "rating": "excellent",
    "soundness": "The methodological approach is logically sound, building on agentic architectures (Dynamic Cheatsheet [41]) and explicitly addressing the identified limitations of brevity bias and context collapse (Section 2.2). The modular workflow of Generator, Reflector, and Curator (Section 3, Figure 4) provides a structured and coherent approach to continuous context adaptation.",
    "experimental_design": "The experimental design is robust, evaluating ACE on two distinct categories of LLM applications: agents (AppWorld benchmark) and domain-specific benchmarks (FINER, Formula for financial analysis) (Section 4.1). Comparisons are made against strong and relevant baselines (ICL, MIPROv2, GEPA, DC) (Section 4.2). Ablation studies (Section 4.5, Table 3) effectively isolate and demonstrate the contribution of individual ACE components.",
    "statistical_rigor": "The paper reports clear average gains and specific percentage improvements (e.g., +10.6% on agents, 8.6% on finance in abstract and Section 4). Tables 1, 2, and 3 include standard deviations/ranges, indicating an assessment of variability. The evaluation metrics (TGC, SGC, Accuracy) are standard and appropriately applied for the respective benchmarks (Section 4.1).",
    "reproducibility": "The paper enhances reproducibility by stating that \"We release the language model prompts used in our agentic context engineering framework as well as the baselines to support research transparency and reproducibility\" (Appendix D). It also references the official implementations for all baselines (DSPy implementations for MIPROv2 [15] and GEPA [14], Dynamic Cheatsheet [42]). The use of an open-source model (DeepSeek-V3.1) further aids in replication.",
    "strengths": [
      "The modular architecture of Generator, Reflector, and Curator (Section 3, Figure 4) provides a clear and effective division of labor for adaptive context engineering, allowing for specialized roles in strategy generation, insight extraction, and structured updates.",
      "The incremental delta updates and grow-and-refine mechanism (Section 3.1, 3.2) effectively mitigate 'context collapse' and 'brevity bias', preserving detailed knowledge and enabling scalable context expansion, which is a significant advancement over prior monolithic rewriting approaches (Figure 2).",
      "ACE facilitates self-improvement without requiring labeled supervision by leveraging natural execution feedback and environment signals, making it highly practical for real-world agentic systems (Section 4.3).",
      "Comprehensive ablation studies (Section 4.5, Table 3) clearly demonstrate the positive impact of specific design choices, such as the Reflector with iterative refinement and multi-epoch adaptation, on the overall performance of the framework."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The paper acknowledges a potential limitation regarding ACE's reliance on a 'reasonably strong Reflector' and notes that performance may degrade without 'reliable feedback signals' (Appendix B, Section 4.4), which could limit its applicability in certain low-feedback environments.",
      "While baselines reference open-source implementations, a direct and prominent link to the ACE framework's own implementation is not provided in the main text, potentially hindering immediate access and reproducibility for researchers."

  },
  "novelty": {
    "rating": "excellent",
    "originality": "The core idea of treating contexts as \"evolving playbooks\" through a modular generation-reflection-curation process (Section 3) is highly original. This approach directly addresses critical and under-explored problems in context adaptation, namely \"brevity bias\" and \"context collapse\" (Section 2.2), offering a unique solution to known limitations.",
    "significance": "ACE holds high potential impact due to its ability to enable self-improving LLM systems with enhanced accuracy, reduced computational cost, and lower latency (Section 4.6, Table 4) even with smaller models (Abstract, Section 4.3). Its modularity and independence from labeled supervision are crucial for advancing future research in online and continuous learning, marking it as a significant contribution to the field.",
    "incremental_vs_breakthrough": "This is a breakthrough contribution. While it builds upon existing agentic architectures like Dynamic Cheatsheet [41], ACE's paradigm shift in structured, incremental context evolution and its explicit solution to context collapse fundamentally redefine how LLM contexts are managed, moving beyond simple prompt optimization or monolithic rewriting.",
    "comparison_to_prior_work": "The paper provides a clear and detailed comparison of ACE with prior works such as Dynamic Cheatsheet [41], Reflexion [40], TextGrad [54], and GEPA [4] in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. It meticulously explains how ACE surpasses these methods by preventing \"brevity bias\" and \"context collapse\" through its mechanism of accumulating and refining detailed playbooks rather than compressing knowledge. Quantitative comparisons in Section 4.3 and 4.4 demonstrate ACE's superior performance over these baselines."

Technical terms are appropriately used and implicitly understood within the domain. The overall flow is logical, making it relatively easy to follow the progression from problem identification to the proposed solution.",
    "organization": "The paper exhibits a logical structure, starting with the abstract and introduction, transitioning to a discussion of prior work's limitations, presenting the ACE framework, detailing experimental results, and concluding with a discussion of implications. Subsections are used effectively to segment content. However, some transitions between paragraphs could be smoother for a more fluid reading experience.",
