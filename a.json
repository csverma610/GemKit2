    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) applications such as agents and domain-specific reasoning increasingly rely on context adaptation—modifying inputs with instructions, strategies, or evidence, rather than weight updates. Prior approaches improve usability but often suffer from brevity bias, which drops domain insights for concise summaries, and from context collapse, where iterative rewriting erodes details over time. Building on the adaptive memory introduced by Dynamic Cheatsheet, we introduce ACE (Agentic Context Engineering), a framework that treats contexts as evolving playbooks that accumulate, refine, and organize strategies through a modular process of generation, reflection, and curation. ACE prevents collapse with structured, incremental updates that preserve detailed knowledge and scale with long-context models. Across agent and domain-specific benchmarks, ACE optimizes contexts both offline (e.g., system prompts) and online (e.g., agent memory), consistently outperforming strong baselines: +10.6% on agents and +8.6% on finance, while significantly reducing adaptation latency and rollout cost. Notably, ACE could adapt effectively without labeled supervision and instead by leveraging natural execution feedback. On the AppWorld leaderboard, ACE matches the top-ranked production-level agent on the overall average and surpasses it on the harder test-challenge split, despite using a smaller open-source model. These results show that comprehensive, evolving contexts enable scalable, efficient, and self-improving LLM systems with low overhead.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces Agentic Context Engineering (ACE), a novel framework for dynamic context adaptation in large language models. ACE addresses limitations like brevity bias and context collapse in existing methods by treating contexts as 'evolving playbooks' through a modular process of generation, reflection, and curation. The framework demonstrates significant performance gains (over 10% on agents, over 8% on finance) and substantial efficiency improvements (e.g., 82.3% reduction in adaptation latency) over strong baselines. ACE's ability to learn without labeled supervision and its competitive performance against larger models highlight its potential for scalable, efficient, and self-improving LLM systems."
  },
  "methodology": {
    "rating": "excellent",
    "soundness": "The ACE framework is well-designed to address the limitations of brevity bias and context collapse in LLM context adaptation. Its modular architecture with Generator, Reflector, and Curator roles provides a sound approach to accumulating, refining, and organizing strategies, as described in Section 3 and Figure 4.",
    "experimental_design": "The experimental design is comprehensive, evaluating ACE on two distinct categories: multi-turn reasoning agents (AppWorld benchmark) and domain-specific benchmarks (FiNER and Formula for financial analysis), as detailed in Section 4.1. The use of multiple baselines (ICL, MIPROv2, GEPA, DC) for both offline and online adaptation strengthens the comparative analysis. Ablation studies (Table 3) further demonstrate the contribution of individual design choices.",
    "statistical_rigor": "The statistical rigor is good. The paper reports average gains and explicitly mentions the range of improvements, e.g., '+10.6% on agents and +8.6% on finance' (Abstract, Page 1). Ablation studies in Table 3 systematically evaluate component contributions. However, the exact statistical significance (p-values) for all reported gains is not explicitly stated beyond percentage improvements, which would further strengthen the claims.",
    "reproducibility": "Reproducibility is well-supported. The paper provides detailed descriptions of the ACE framework components (Section 3), task and dataset specifications (Section 4.1), baselines and methods used (Section 4.2), and crucially, includes the language model prompts in Appendix D (Figures 6-14). This level of detail is commendable and should allow researchers to replicate the work.",
    "strengths": [
      "The modular architecture of Generator, Reflector, and Curator provides a clear and effective division of labor for context adaptation, as illustrated in Figure 4.",
      "The incremental delta updates and grow-and-refine mechanism effectively prevent context collapse and preserve detailed knowledge over time, a significant improvement over prior methods (Section 3.1, 3.2).",
      "The framework's ability to operate effectively without labeled supervision, leveraging natural execution feedback, is a key strength for self-improving agents (Section 2, Page 2).",
      "The paper demonstrates strong efficiency gains, significantly reducing adaptation latency, rollouts, and token costs compared to baselines (Table 4, Section 4.6)."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The paper acknowledges a potential limitation: ACE's reliance on a reasonably strong Reflector, where a weak Reflector could lead to noisy or harmful contexts (Section B, Page 14).",
      "The effectiveness of ACE can degrade when ground-truth supervision or reliable execution signals are absent, especially in domain-specific tasks, which highlights a dependency on feedback quality (Section 4.4, Page 8)."
    ]
  },
  "novelty": {
    "rating": "excellent",
    "originality": "The ACE framework introduces a novel approach to context adaptation by treating contexts as 'evolving playbooks' that accumulate, refine, and organize strategies through a modular generation, reflection, and curation process. This is distinct from prior methods that often suffer from brevity bias and context collapse (Section 2.2).",
    "significance": "The significance is high. ACE addresses fundamental limitations in current LLM context adaptation, offering a scalable, efficient, and self-improving paradigm. Its ability to outperform strong baselines while using smaller models and reducing costs has practical implications for developing more robust AI systems (Abstract, Section 4).",
    "incremental_vs_breakthrough": "ACE represents a breakthrough in context engineering for LLMs. It moves beyond incremental improvements by fundamentally re-conceptualizing how contexts are managed, specifically by preventing collapse and enabling continuous, structured growth of knowledge (Section 3).",
    "comparison_to_prior_work": "The paper provides a thorough comparison to prior work, including ICL, MIPROv2, GEPA, and Dynamic Cheatsheet, clearly outlining how ACE overcomes their limitations, particularly brevity bias and context collapse, as discussed in Section 2.2 and quantitatively shown in Tables 1 and 2."

  "writing": {
    "rating": "excellent",
    "clarity": "The paper is exceptionally clear. Concepts like brevity bias, context collapse, and the ACE framework's components are explained with precision. The workflow in Figure 4 is easy to follow, and the explanations of experimental setups are lucid.",
    "organization": "The organization is excellent. The paper logically progresses from problem definition (Section 2), to proposed solution (Section 3), detailed experiments and results (Section 4), and a discussion of implications and limitations (Section 5, Appendix B). The use of headings and subheadings is consistent and helpful.",
    "grammar_and_style": "The grammar and style are professional and polished throughout. The language is academic yet accessible, with no noticeable grammatical errors or awkward phrasing. The tone is objective and informative.",
    "suggestions": [
      "Ensure all acronyms are defined at their first appearance; for example, 'KV cache' is used in Section 2.1 before its full form is given (although it is a common term).",
      "Consider adding a brief summary paragraph at the end of Section 3, following the detailed descriptions of innovations, to reinforce the key takeaways before moving to results."

    "comments_for_authors": "This paper introduces ACE, a novel and highly effective framework for Agentic Context Engineering that addresses critical limitations in current LLM context adaptation, namely brevity bias and context collapse. The modular design, featuring Generator, Reflector, and Curator components, is well-conceived and contributes to the system's ability to accumulate and refine strategies over time. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, demonstrating significant performance gains (e.g., +10.6% on agents, +8.6% on finance) and remarkable efficiency improvements (e.g., 82.3% reduction in latency) over strong baselines across diverse benchmarks. The ability of ACE to operate without labeled supervision by leveraging execution feedback is a key strength, enhancing its applicability to self-improving agents. The transparency through detailed methodology and provision of prompts in the appendix is commendable. Minor suggestions for improvement include ensuring consistent column ordering in tables and potentially providing more empirical evidence for the long-term cost analysis of longer contexts. Overall, this is an excellent paper presenting a significant advancement in the field of LLM context management.",
    "confidential_comments_to_editor": "This is a strong paper presenting a highly original and impactful framework.
